## v1.7.2 — 2026-05-18

### Camera wall — size controls & stream stability

- **½× compact size mode** — new first button in every cam-wall card header. A ½× card spans one sub-column (~160 px min), so four compact cameras fit in the horizontal space of one 2× card. The card header adapts automatically (smaller padding, brand pill hidden, reduced button size).
- **Overlay headers** — cam-wall card headers are now `position: absolute` and float over the top of the camera feed with a dark gradient, hidden at rest and revealed on hover. This removes the fixed header height from the card's layout, so card height is determined purely by the 16:9 camera content. Two ½× cameras stacked no longer exceed the height of one 2× camera.
- **`align-items: start` on the cam wall grid** — cards are sized to their content only; cards in the same grid row no longer stretch to match the tallest neighbour (which caused large black voids below 1× cameras placed next to 2× ones).
- **Patch-mode render — no stream restart on size/order change** — `_renderPrinterCam` now detects when only `camSize` or `camSortIndex` changed (Firestore echo after a button click or DnD drop). It updates CSS classes and `style.order` in-place on the existing DOM nodes, never touching `host.innerHTML`. iframe WebRTC sessions and MJPEG streams survive size changes and reordering completely.
- **CSS `order`-based DnD reorder** — drag-and-drop reorder now reassigns `card.style.order` values instead of moving DOM nodes (`insertBefore` / `insertAdjacentElement`). Browsers reload iframes on any DOM detach+reattach; the CSS `order` approach keeps every node in its original DOM position so WebRTC and MJPEG streams are never interrupted.
- **Fullscreen header** — in `--fs` mode the header reverts to normal document flow (visible, background `--surface`, border-bottom) so the flex column layout fills the viewport correctly.
- **i18n** — 4 new keys across all 9 locales: `camSizeCompact`, `camSizeNormal`, `camSizeWide`, `camSizeFullscreen`.

### Windows 10 — crash on launch fix

- **Root cause**: `startRendererServer` bound the dev HTTP server to `'localhost'`. On Windows 10 with Node.js 17+ (bundled in Electron 41), `localhost` resolves to `::1` (IPv6). If IPv6 is disabled on the machine, `server.listen` fails with `EADDRNOTAVAIL` — not `EADDRINUSE` — which hit the `else { reject(err); }` branch and raised an unhandled promise rejection. In Node.js 15+, unhandled rejections terminate the process, causing the app to crash silently at every launch.
- **Fix**: the server now binds to `'127.0.0.1'` explicitly across all code paths (initial listen, EADDRINUSE fallback, other-error fallback). All error branches now call `resolve()` with a fallback random port — the process can never be crashed by a server-bind failure. Added `.catch()` on the `startRendererServer().then()` call in `createWindow()`.

### MJPEG cam_manager — generic mux module

- **`renderer/printers/cam_manager.js`** (new) — brand-agnostic MJPEG stream multiplexer extracted from `flashforge/cam_mux.js`. One `fetch()` per printer key, N consumer `<img>` elements receive each JPEG frame as a `blob:` URL. A 2-second grace period on last-consumer-unregister avoids unnecessary reconnections when the user switches between views (sidecard open/close, cam wall / grid toggle).
- **`flashforge/cam_mux.js`** now delegates entirely to `cam_manager` via six re-exported aliases (`camStart` → `ffgMuxStart`, etc.). The FlashForge-named public API is preserved for callers.

### Creality — connection stability

- **`creConnect` IP guard** — early-return if no `printer.ip` is configured (avoids silently opening a WebSocket to an empty string).
- **Abandoned connection fast-path** — `crePingPrinter` skips the HTTP probe and immediately returns `offline` for connections flagged `_abandoned` (3+ consecutive failures), avoiding redundant network round-trips.
- **Already-managed IP** — `creConnect` now treats any existing conn with the same IP as "already managing" (even if `_abandoned`), deferring to an explicit user reconnect instead of silently replacing it.

## v1.7.1 — 2026-05-17

### Printer grid & table — live status and progress

- **Status pills in grid cards and table** — every connected printer now shows its live state (Idle, Printing, Paused, Preparing, Complete, Error, …) directly in the grid card and table row without opening the sidecard. Offline printers show nothing; connected-but-idle printers show a muted grey pill; active jobs show the progress bar + `XX% · 1h 23m`.
- **ISO visual style** — the state pills in cards and table use the exact same `snap-job-state snap-job-state--{state}` classes as the sidecard, scaled via `.snap-job-state--compact`. Spinning ring animation on `printing` and `preparing`, colour-coded per state (blue=printing, amber=paused/preparing, green=complete/finished, red=error/failed, grey=idle/standby/ready).
- **Online badge pill** in grid cards now matches the sidecard pill: rounded background + coloured border (green for online, amber for connecting, grey for offline).
- **Filename + remaining time** — when a job is active, the truncated filename appears below the progress bar and remaining time is shown alongside the percentage (`42% · 1h 23m`). BambuLab, Elegoo, and Creality expose remaining time; all brands expose the filename when printing.
- **Cross-brand normalisation** — `_getPrinterJob` now returns a uniform `{ state, pct, isActive, filename, remainSec }` for all five brands. Creality's numeric `d.state` is normalised to `idle`/`printing`/`complete`; remaining time converted from brand-specific units (BambuLab minutes, Elegoo ms, Creality seconds).
- **New i18n keys** across all 9 locales: `snapState_finished`, `snapState_preparing`, `snapState_failed`, `snapState_ready`.

### Printer grid — Online/Offline partition fix (all brands)

- **Root cause**: `ctx.onPrinterGridChange` referenced `_printerSub`, a `const` scoped inside `renderPrintersView()`. In strict mode (ES modules) this threw a silent `ReferenceError` on every RAF tick, swallowing the re-partition call — printers that connected after the initial render were stuck in the Offline section indefinitely. Fixed: `state.viewMode !== "printer-cam"`.
- **RAF coalescing race** (all 4 brand drivers): the shared RAF flag for `statusChanged=true` (re-partition) and `statusChanged=false` (surgical job patch) could block the connected-status RAF on a fast LAN. Fixed by splitting into two independent flags (`_xxxStatusRaf` / `_xxxGridRaf`) per brand.

### Camera improvements

- **Cam wall card → click → sidecard** — clicking any camera wall card opens the sidecard for that printer. CSS `cursor: pointer` + `border-color` hover feedback on `.cam-wall-card`.
- **FlashForge MJPEG multiplexer** (`cam_mux.js`) — a single `fetch()` reads the MJPEG stream and distributes JPEG frames to all registered `<img>` consumers (cam wall + sidecard simultaneously) with zero extra connections. Respects FlashForge's 1-client limit. Stream auto-stops when the last consumer unregisters.
- **Creality camera persistence** — `_activeIp` tracking prevents redundant WebRTC restarts on WS reconnect. `#creCamContainer` persists in the DOM; `.cre-cam-hidden` toggled by CSS instead of DOM removal.

---

## v1.7.0 — 2026-05-15

### DB pipeline — unified reference data layer
- **`tigertagDbService`** is now the single source of truth for all TigerTag reference JSON files (brands, materials, aspects, types, diameters, units, versions). The renderer loads these via IPC (`window.electronAPI.db.getLookups()`) instead of direct `fetch()` calls, so both the inventory view and the live printer integrations draw from the same data.
- **`assets/db/tigertag/`** — reference files relocated to `assets/db/tigertag/id_*.json` (official TigerTag naming). A `last_update.json` timestamp file is bundled alongside so the app knows the embedded data's age from day one.
- **GitHub mirror fallback** — `tigertagDbService` tries the TigerTag API first; if unreachable it falls back to the auto-synced GitHub mirror (≤ 6 h stale). Offline users still get their last cached copy from `userData/db/tigertag/`.
- **Atomic writes with JSON validation** — every dataset is validated (non-empty array, each entry has `id`) before overwriting the local cache file. A truncated or malformed API response is rejected; the previous good file is kept intact.
- **First-launch seed** — on a fresh install, `tigertagDbService` reads `last_update.json` bundled in `assets/db/tigertag/` and seeds the metadata store so the app skips unnecessary network downloads for data that shipped with the installer.

### Bambu Lab — filament edit sheet redesign
- **ISO layout** — the Bambu filament edit bottom-sheet now matches the Snapmaker / FlashForge / Elegoo design: two rows only (Filament + Color), no summary bar, no close ✕ button, no horizontal separators.
- **Auto-close on color select** — picking a color from the preset grid or the OS color picker closes the color sub-sheet automatically (150 ms delay, same behavior as other brands).
- **Title corrected** — sheet is now labeled "Edit filament" instead of the previous "Change filament".

### i18n
- Added **`snapState_idle`** key across all 9 locales (EN/FR/DE/ES/IT/ZH/PT/PT-PT/PL) — resolves the raw-key label that was showing in the Bambu Lab printer state badge.

---

## v1.6.0 — 2026-05-14

### Elegoo — full MQTT live integration
- **Real-time MQTT connection** on port 1883 (plain TCP). UDP discovery on port 52700 auto-detects Elegoo printers; manual IP entry is the fallback.
- **Job card** — active filename, progress bar + percentage, estimated remaining time, layer counter (`current / total`), print thumbnail, and state badge (`printing`, `paused`, `complete`, `standby`, …).
- **Temperature card** — nozzle `current / target°C`, bed `current / target°C`, chamber temperature; heating indicator when target is set and sensor is below threshold.
- **Filament card** — mono-extruder mode (`Ext.`) and Canvas hub 4-slot mode (`S1`–`S4`); each slot shows colour square, material type, vendor, and filament name. Partial MQTT updates (method 6000 `mono_filament_info`) merge only the fields present in the payload — existing data is preserved.
- **Control card** — jog pad with XY circle (4-direction buttons + sector highlight + centre home-XY), Z pill (Z↑ / home-Z / Z↓), X/Y home pill, step selector (0.1 / 1 / 10 / 30 mm), print-speed selector (Silent / Normal / Sport / Ludicrous), current-position display (X / Y / Z), LED toggle, and folder button.
- **Fan cards** — Model / Aux / Case fans as three compact column cards each with icon toggle, − / % / + step buttons (±10% per step).
- **Files sheet** — two tabs: Print History (thumbnails + filename + duration) and Files (printer-side file list). Refresh reloads the active tab without closing the sheet.
- **Filament edit sheet** — colour preset grid + custom hex picker, material type list, vendor picker, summary preview, sends correct MQTT payloads (method 1055 for mono, method 2003 for Canvas).
- **No-flash control card** — surgical DOM patch on every MQTT tick: fan percentages, LED state, and XYZ position are updated in-place without re-creating the control card DOM.
- **i18n** — all UI strings covered across 9 locales (EN / FR / DE / ES / IT / ZH / PT / PT-PT / PL).

### Bambu Lab — live integration
- **MQTTS connection** on port 8883 (TLS). Auth via printer access code (entered once). Requires "LAN mode" enabled on the printer.
- **Job card** — filename, progress bar, estimated remaining time, layer counter, and print state.
- **Temperature card** — nozzle, bed, and chamber temperatures with heating indicators.
- **Filament / AMS card** — row 1 is `[Ext.] [A1][A2][A3][A4]`; additional rows for extra AMS units. AMS humidity and temperature shown when a single module is connected.
- **Camera widget** — JPEG stream from the printer's built-in camera.
- **Online badge** — driven by the MQTT connection state, shown in the printer grid and side panel.

### UI polish — printer live blocks
- Elegoo control card — borders removed for a cleaner look; home buttons keep orange hover/active state.
- Fan cards — columns layout (one card per fan), no borders, 8 px gap between cards.
- Filament mono slot — `Ext.` alone capped to `max-width: calc((100% - 32px) / 5)` so it renders at the same size as one slot in a full Ext. + AMS row.

---

## v1.5.0 — 2026-05-11

### TigerScale — live WebSocket panel
- **Connect / disconnect toggle** on each scale card. Manual disconnect suppresses auto-reconnect.
- **WS event log** — collapsible strip showing the last 80 events (connect, raw frames, errors, retries) with direction arrows and per-line timestamps.
- **CORS fix** — removed the pre-connect `fetch()` ping (blocked by Chromium CORS in Electron). `connectScaleWs` now opens the WebSocket directly; `onclose` handles retries.
- **Field-name fix** — WS parser corrected from snake_case to the actual camelCase fields the firmware sends (`netWeight`, `scaleStatus`).
- **Gradient live card** — shows live data with a purple gradient matching the TigerScale mobile app. Hidden when WS is disconnected; reappears on reconnect.
- **Send-status badge** — maps `scaleStatus` firmware values (`idle`, `scanning:N`, `stable:N`, `send`, `success`, `error`, `done`, `ready`) to emoji + text with per-state background colours.
- **Filament mini-panel** — colour dot, brand, and material. Appears only when the firmware sends non-empty brand or material; clears automatically when `scaleStatus` becomes `"ready"`.
- **Weight display** — 56 px bold weight number with unit.
- **UID reader grid** — 2-column grid (Left reader / Right reader). `resolve()` fills the empty slot with the twin UID in green.
- **TARE hold-to-confirm** — 1-second press fills a white progress bar then POSTs `/api/tare`. Button hidden when disconnected.

### Elegoo — thumbnail correlation fix
- History thumbnail responses are now correlated by `_historyThumbPendingFn !== null` rather than by request ID. The Elegoo firmware echoes the method number (1045) as the response `id` — not our incremental request ID — so ID-based matching never worked and thumbnails were silently dropped.

---

## v1.4.15 — 2026-05-09

### Creality live integration
- Real-time WebSocket connection on port 9999 with automatic heartbeat (polling every 2 s).
- Live nozzle, bed, and enclosure temperatures; print state (`idle` / `printing` / `finished`), job progress bar, layer counter, estimated duration.
- **CFS colour grid** — activated when `cfsConnect=1` and `materialBoxs[]` is non-empty; shows each slot's assigned colour pill and material label.
- **WebRTC camera** — inline `<iframe>` at `http://$ip/webcam/webrtc` when `webrtcSupport=1`.
- **Print thumbnail** — fetched from `http://$ip/downloads/original/current_print_image.png` while a job is active.
- WS event log with Pause / Clear / row-expand, same UI as Snapmaker and FlashForge.
- Online / Offline badge driven by a lightweight WS probe (30 s TTL).

---

## v1.4.14 — 2026-05-08

### Add Product — multi-colour picker (Mono / Dual / Tri / Rainbow)
- New **Mono / Dual / Tri / Rainbow** selector in the colour picker bottom-sheet. Tap a colour square to switch the active slot, then pick its colour.
- The colour circle updates in real time: solid (Mono), hard half-split (Dual), conic-gradient sectors (Tri), smooth linear-gradient (Rainbow).
- Selecting a mode auto-sets `id_aspect2` to the matching aspect. The link is bidirectional — changing the aspect2 dropdown also flips the mode selector.
- `color_r2/g2/b2` and `color_r3/g3/b3` now written from the actual slot colours picked.

### Version / protocol filter
- The **Type** quick-filter in the inventory toolbar now filters by **protocol version** (TigerTag / TigerTag+ / TigerTag Cloud / TigerTag Init / …) instead of filament product type.

### Search & filter reset on instance switch
- The search bar and all quick-filters are now automatically cleared when switching between accounts or entering / leaving a friend's inventory view.

---

## v1.4.13 — 2026-05-07

### Custom product image for DIY & Cloud spools
- **`url_img` + `url_img_user: true`** — DIY and Cloud spools can now carry a product image from an external URL. TigerTag+ spools are not editable.
- **Edit pill in the colour square** — expands rightward on click to reveal the URL input and a confirm button. `Enter` = confirm, `Escape` = dismiss.
- **Toolbox entry** — when a valid user image is already set, the edit action moves to the spool toolbox.
- **Broken-link recovery** — `onerror` handler detects failed image loads, swaps in the colour placeholder, and surfaces the edit trigger.
- **Add Product integration** — the ADP advanced section has an image URL field.

### Toolbox — Clear TD value
- New split-button on the "Scan TD" toolbox row: a hold-to-confirm trash button (1 200 ms) appears to the right when `r.td != null`. Holding it deletes the `TD` field via `FieldValue.delete()`.

### Add Product panel — TD1S sensor button
- TD1S icon added to the ADP header. **Not connected** → opens the TD1S connect modal. **Connected** → glows green; scanning a filament auto-fills the colour HEX and TD value fields.

### Stats bar — TigerTag Cloud counter
- New purple stat tile ("TigerTag Cloud") always visible in the inventory header bar. DIY count now correctly excludes Cloud entries.

### Window chrome
- **Dark title bar** — `nativeTheme.themeSource = 'dark'` forces the native macOS/Windows title bar to dark mode.
- **No window shadow** — `hasShadow: false` removes the OS-level drop shadow along window edges.
- **Update status icon** — sits to the right of the cloud health indicator. Orange + spinning during download; green + glow when ready. Clicking the green icon triggers the install.
- **Panel shadow bleed fix** — `detail-panel`, `sfe-sheet`, and `rp-side` were leaking `box-shadow` outside the viewport when off-screen. Shadow now applied only on `.open` / `.is-open` state.

---

## v1.4.12 — 2026-05-06

> 🌥️ **The big one: TigerTag goes Cloud.** Create a filament in your inventory without owning an RFID chip. When you eventually program a chip, the doc is atomically renamed to its real hex UID — all fields, twins, rack assignments, and friend ACLs follow with no manual effort.

### TigerTag Cloud — third tier
- **100 % digital filaments** — the Add Product side panel writes a complete inventory entry with a `CLOUD_<10-digit>` doc id. Same schema, same fields, same display surfaces, same friend-sharing rules as chip-backed spools.
- **Promotion path** — when a physical chip is programmed, the `uidMigrationMap` rename pipeline carries the document over atomically. Twin pointers, rack assignments, weight history, friend ACLs — everything follows the rename. Idempotent.
- **New tier label "TigerTag Cloud"** — sits alongside TigerTag+ (orange) and TigerTag (grey). Cloud takes precedence when both signals would apply. Shown across table row, grid card, panel image overlay, and panel details footer.
- New CSS class `.tag-cloud` — purple gradient (`#7c4dff → #a37bff`).

### Add Product — full HSV colour picker
- Anthracite preset sheet matching the Brand / Material sheets.
- Custom slot shows the current colour as background.
- Custom-colour bottom-sheet rebuilt as an HSV picker: hex input row, saturation × value rectangle, hue slider, colour preview circle, OK button.
- Live main-circle update while dragging the SV thumb / hue slider / typing.

### Add Product — RFID Data debug surface
- Gated to `state.debugEnabled` (admin only). Non-admin users never see the section.
- Moved out of Advanced mode — always visible to debug users.
- Switched to the canonical `<details class="debug">` pattern with `pre.json` dark theme.

---

## v1.4.11 — 2026-05-05

### FlashForge live integration
- **HTTP polling** — 2 s tick on `POST /detail`, bridged through the Electron main process to bypass CORS. Capped exponential backoff on network errors (2 s → 30 s).
- **Camera (MJPEG)** — edge-to-edge `<img>` stream. Handles mjpg-streamer's 1-client limit: cache-buster on open, explicit tear-down on close, graceful fallback + Retry button on error.
- **5-slot matlStation grid** — `[Ext.] [1A] [1B] [1C] [1D]`. Ext. → `indepMatlInfo`; bays → `slotInfos[1..4]`. Three visual states per slot: filled (solid fill), configured-but-empty (coloured inset ring), unconfigured (grey hatch).
- **Auto SN-prefix** — auto-prefixes `SN` when the entered serial is missing it. Idempotent.
- **Request log (debug mode)** — every poll pushes an outbound + inbound entry. Click to expand JSON; Pause / Clear toolbar; capped at 100 entries (FIFO).

### UX — Inventory toolbar redesign
- **View selector moved below the search bar** — own dedicated row under the search, keeping its full width regardless of how wide the filters above end up.
- **Search input — clear button (✕)** — appears on the left of the magnifier icon as soon as the input contains a value.

---

## v1.4.10 — 2026-05-05

Hot-fix release for the Windows auto-updater.

- **Windows auto-update fixed.** `build.publish.publisherName: null` set to skip publisher-name verification on Windows (the SHA-512 hash check from `latest.yml` still enforces integrity). Fixes the `Could not check: New version is not signed by the application owner` error that blocked v1.4.9 auto-updates.
- **Mobile-app prerequisite warning** added to the inventory format upgrade consent modal — a small amber banner reminds the user to update their TigerTag mobile app to v1.0.3+ before continuing.

---

## v1.4.9 — 2026-05-04

Quality-of-life release. Three internal-tooling improvements and one user-visible bug fix found by the new tooling on its first run.

### i18n bug fixes
- `autoUnstorageTitle` and `autoUnstorageSub` were missing from `zh.json` and `pt-pt.json`.
- Five duration keys (`agoMin`, `agoHour`, `agoDay`, `agoMonth`, `agoYear`) now use the same plural-object structure (`{one, other}`) across all 9 locales.

### Internal tooling
- **`npm run i18n:add`** — single command adds or updates one i18n key across all 9 locale files.
- **`npm run i18n:check` + pre-commit hook** — validates locale consistency on every commit. Wired automatically via `core.hooksPath=.githooks/` from the `prepare` script.
- **CSS modularization** — the 8047-line monolithic `inventory.css` split into 8 themed files under `renderer/css/` (`00-base.css` through `70-detail-misc.css`).

---

## v1.4.8 — 2026-05-04

Discovery, repair & ergonomics release.

### Snapmaker LAN discovery
- **Side-panel scan** — slides in from the right. mDNS browse of `_snapmaker._tcp.local.` via `bonjour-service` (IPC bridge `mdns:browse-snapmaker`), plus port-scan fallback on Moonraker port 7125.
- **Per-source batch sizing** — local subnets with batch=24, user-declared extra subnets with batch=4 + 80 ms inter-batch gap.
- **One-click add** — writes the printer doc to Firestore and opens the new printer's detail card with the WebSocket already connecting.
- **Add by IP** collapsible — live IPv4 validation, "Validate" probe, "Continue anyway" fallback.
- **Debug-only scan log** — full journal exportable as JSON.
- **Settings reconnect** — saving an IP change tears down the old WebSocket and reconnects.

### Twin-pair manual repair
- **Repair tool** in the spool detail panel toolbox when the spool isn't paired AND at least one compatible candidate exists.
- **Strict candidate filter** — same `id_brand` + `id_material` + `id_type` + `id_tigertag` + exact RGB. Excludes already-paired and tombstoned rows.
- **Atomic batch write** — `twin_tag_uid` cross-referenced on both docs in a single Firestore batch.
- **Debug-only Unlink** — hold-to-confirm "Unlink" tool when Debug mode is on.

### Spool toolbox (detail panel)
- Bundles: Scan colour (TD1S), Scan TD (TD1S), Link/Unlink twin, Remove from rack, Delete.
- Apple-style row design — borderless soft surface, capsule shapes, hold-to-confirm fill animation for destructive actions.

### Rack management
- **Drop-to-void unassign** — dragging a spool outside any rack card sends it back to the unranked panel.
- **Eject animation** reuses `rp-slot-cascade-out`, matching auto-store / auto-fill visual grammar.
- **Empty-spool handling in unranked** — visible but excluded from every count.
- **Per-spool "Remove from rack"** in the toolbox (hold 1.5 s).

### Filament slot UI (Snapmaker live block)
- Cleaner colour square layout — BASE material only in the square, full identity below.
- **Read-only filament sheet** — same layout as editable mode; `<select>` and "Apply" are `disabled`.

---

## v1.4.7 — 2026-05-04

Major release — 3D Printer integration as a first-class citizen.

### Printer management
- **New "Printers" tab** — drag & drop grid of all printers across 5 brands. Per-card: photo, brand pill, model, online/offline indicator (HTTP ping every 30 s).
- **Side card** — slides from the right; hero shows static photo or live WebRTC camera for Snapmaker.
- **"Add a printer" flow** — brand picker → form. Brand-aware model picker with thumbnails. Written to `users/{uid}/printers/{brand}/devices/{auto-id}` in Firestore.
- **Inline editing in the side card** — every field editable on click; Enter / blur saves to Firestore.

### Snapmaker live integration (Moonraker WebSocket)
- WebSocket to `ws://{ip}:7125/websocket`, JSON-RPC subscribe, capped exponential backoff.
- **Camera** — full-width WebRTC iframe at the top of the side card.
- **Print job card** — preview thumbnail, filename, percentage, elapsed time, progress bar, state pill, layer counter.
- **Temperature row** — compact pills per extruder + bed, red when heating.
- **Filament grid** — 4 large coloured squares (one per extruder), tap-to-edit with pencil / eye icon.
- **Inline filament editor** — bottom sheet: Summary, Filament picker (vendor × material), Color picker (5×5 grid + OS-native custom), Sub-type `<select>`.
- **Request log** (debug mode) — every WS frame in / out, pause / clear, custom JSON send.

### Storage data — schema migration
- `rack_id` / `level` / `position` top-level fields repackaged into a nested `rack: { id, level, position }` sub-object. Same UX pattern as the v1.4.5 UID migration. Twin-aware — every rack write mirrors to the linked twin's doc in the same atomic batch.

---

## v1.4.6 — 2026-05-03

Hot-fix — Windows packaging.

- **Windows artifact name standardised.** `win.artifactName` set to `Tiger-Studio-Manager-Setup-${version}.${ext}` (space-free). Fixes the auto-updater 404 that resulted from GitHub's space→dot rewrite disagreeing with electron-builder's dash encoding in `latest.yml`.
- **Windows code-signature check temporarily disabled.** `nsis.publisherName: []` added. electron-builder was auto-deriving the publisher name from the macOS Apple Developer ID, which never matches the unsigned `.exe`. SHA-512 + size check from `latest.yml` is still enforced.

---

## v1.4.5 — 2026-05-03

- **Google sign-in via Touch ID / passkey.** Loopback OAuth flow (RFC 8252 + PKCE) — the system browser opens for auth so Touch ID, passkeys, and hardware keys work natively. System browser brought back to foreground automatically after the handshake.
- **Lazy on-the-fly migration of legacy decimal spool ids → hex uppercase.** Idempotent, atomic per spool (single Firestore batch per migration), polite (250-500 ms gap between writes). `users/{uid}/uidMigrationMap/{decimal_uid}` serves as a bridge for in-flight legacy UIDs.
- **Migration consent + progress UI.** Consent modal shows spool count + estimated duration; lock-screen progress modal during the sweep. Cmd+Q during migration intercepted by main process — native dialog asks for confirmation before quitting.
- **TigerScale v2 schema cutover.** New field names: `last_heartbeat_at`, `display_name`, `current_spool_uid_1/2`, `wifi_signal_dbm`, `power_source`, `battery_percent`, `is_charging`, `hardware_revision`.
- **Twin-pair display on the TigerScale side-card.** Two tags that reference each other via `twin_tag_uid` render as a single physical spool card.
- **Friend banner repositioned** — the READ-ONLY pill now lives in the top header (left of KPI stats). Own-user mode shows a random welcome greeting instead.
- **Sidebar avatar — swap-back affordance** — a ⇄ badge appears when a friend's inventory is being previewed. The whole avatar acts as a one-click "return to my own inventory" button.

---

## v1.4.4 — 2026-05-02

- **Auto-update toggle.** New "Updates" section in Settings — enable / disable automatic update downloads, and a "Check for updates now" button. Preference persisted to `<userData>/auto-update.json`.
- **Settings panel rebuilt.** Flat panel with hairline-separated sections — Updates / Data / Tools / About — replacing the old card-in-card layout.
- **Top header KPI stats.** 4 stat tiles (Spools / Stock / TigerTag / TigerTag+) moved from the sidebar to the top of the main pane.
- **Storage — `EMPTY` stat for depleted spools.** Slot "Empty" → "Free"; spool "Depleted" → "Empty".
- **Spool detail — Storage location row.** Shows `Rack name · A3` for placed spools; **Auto-assign** button for unplaced spools.
- **Auto Storage + Auto Unstorage** toggles — snapshot-driven, `_inFlight` flag prevents loops.
- **Sidebar — friends quick-access list.** Friends appear under the Friends button as flat rows (avatar + name); click switches the inventory view to that friend's read-only inventory.
- **Readable initials on light avatar colours.** `readableTextOn(bg)` helper computes WCAG relative luminance and switches initials to `#1a1a1a` on light backgrounds.

---

## v1.4.3 — 2026-05-02

Storage view major UX overhaul.

- **Stats bar** — pill tiles: total racks, filled-vs-total slots (mini progress bar), empty count, locked count, clickable "Not Stored" tile. Empty / Locked tiles double as filter chips.
- **Inline rack header** — `Rack 4 · 5/5` on a single line.
- **Kebab menu (⋮)** — per-rack actions: Edit · Auto-fill · Lock all / Unlock all · Clear all · Delete.
- **Press-and-hold for destructive actions** — 1.2-second hold for Clear all and Delete.
- **Visible drop zones during drag** — valid slots pulse, locked slots dim, target slot pops with orange ring + scale-up. Swap targets show `⇄` glyph overlay.
- **Slot animations** — bounce-in on land, staggered 30 ms auto-fill wave, cascade-out for clear-all.
- **Skyline masonry layout** — racks pack tightly into available width; recomputes on resize via `ResizeObserver`.
- **Rich hover tooltip on filled slots** — brand, material · color name, coordinate badge, weight bar.
- **+ New Rack as a stat tile** — first tile of the stats bar, dashed border, `+` glyph.

## v1.4.2 — 2026-05-02

- **CI — macOS code signing + notarization.** Releases signed with Apple Developer ID Application + notarized via `notarytool`. No Gatekeeper warning on download. Certificate and App Store Connect API Key decoded from GitHub Secrets at build time.
- **Native modules** (`@pokusew/pcsclite`, `@serialport/bindings-cpp`) correctly signed inside the bundle via `entitlementsInherit` and `cs.disable-library-validation`.
- New `build:mac:unsigned` script for fast local builds without Apple credentials.

## v1.4.1 — 2026-05-01

- **Fix — silent login failure on email/password** sign-in. Auth listener was gated on `getActiveId()` matching the new uid, but `setActiveId()` only ran inside the listener. Reordered: `setActiveId` runs after `updateCurrentUser` and before `setupNamedAuth`.
- **Diagnostic report system.** Every caught auth/network error and every `window.error` / `unhandledrejection` captured into a circular buffer. Copy a Markdown report from **Settings → Debug → Report a problem** — includes app version, Electron/Chrome/Node, OS, locale, account count, and the last 50 errors with stack traces.
- Storage / Rack feature gated off in this build until the visualisation skeleton is finalised.
